# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved


### Project Description ###
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of 
them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income 
levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for 
example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, 
and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be 
automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every 
commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I use Scikit-learn with other machine learning 
techniques, to build an 
automatic credit card approval predictor just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository.
